                    Peter Parker is a completely average and unassuming college student. He's broke, uncool, and unimportant. He's smart, but that gets him into more trouble than it's worth. 
                    He's often bullied or overlooked. At home, his Aunt May and Uncle Ben serve as his guardians and mentors. Bestowing upon him wisdom and kindness beyond his years. There 
                    are other people in his life too. There is the beautiful Mary Jane Watson, Peter's lifelong crush and girl next door. Also, Harry Osborn, who is Peter's childhood best 
                    friend and son of Norman Osborn, owner of Oscorp. Yes, there is nothing special about this all american nerd from Queens. However, during a class field-trip, Peter is 
                    bitten by a radioactive spider changing his life forever.
                </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    Gifted with amazing spider-like powers, Peter Parker takes on the mantle of Spider-Man, protector of New York. But he's not perfect and has much to learn. While trying 
                    to abuse his power for greed, Peter inadvertently gets his uncle killed. While dying uncle in the arms of the son he never had, Uncle Ben bestows upon Peter a phrase 
                    that goes on to define the Spider-Man ethos for decades to come, <strong>"With great power, comes great responsibility"</strong>. Over the years, Spider-Man will go on 
                    to fight Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin, a man made of living sand, a symbiotic alien that tries to ruin his life, a man with six powerful metal arms, and so many 
                    more villains. All the while keeping his uncle's advice close to his heart.
                </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    Although Spider-Man is the one thing standing between the destruction of New York, he is still Peter Parker. He constantly must choose between Peter or Spidey and it's 
                    never a winning fight. Someone almost always loses and it is usually him. Yet he pushes on, he always gets back up. Day after day, Peter becomes Spider-Man and goes 
                    above and beyond to save his friends, his family, and even some of his enemies. He laughs, he loves, and he makes mistakes.

                    This is one of the many stories of Spider-Man. But you might ask, what if Peter never got bit? What if Uncle Ben never died? But what if something was different? Enter 
                    the Spider-Verse! This page aims to give a brief oversight of the different Spider-People from Peter's original universe and beyond...
