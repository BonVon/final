                <p class="grid-item item1">-For over 60 years, the web-slinging, wall-crawling, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man 
                   has been entertaining and inspiring millions across the world. Originally, from the
                   great mind of Stan Lee, Spider-Man is one of the most iconic superheros worldwide. From hundreds
                   of comics, dozens of games, and an impresisve list of blockbuster movies, Spidey has 
                   taken the world by storm and there is no sign of him stopping any time soon. 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   There is a lot to love about Spider-Man. In addition to his unique set of skills, Spider-Man has one of the most 
                   interesting and relatable stories to tell. He is not an alien born on a dying world, or a god, or a chosen hero 
                   with a fated destiny to fulfill. Peter Parker is a broke, uncool, unpopular, and, aside from his genius level 
                   intellect, generally unskilled. Which, especially for its time, was revolutionary. The story of Spider-Man is 
                   much darker and personal than most would give it credit for at a first glance. Spider-Man's hardest battle is 
                   not between a flying metal man, or an insane super soldier, or even living sand. Peter Parker must always choose 
                   whether he is Spider-Man or Peter Parker because he can never be both. This is a more complex topic however that 
                   deserves its own discussion. Instead, I would rather you take the time to browse this site for a crash course into 
                   the most essential elements of Spider-Man.

                   Yes, millions around the world love and adore Spider-Man but if you have not yet been introduced,
                   browse this site and find out why people around the world love New Yorks favorite Web-Head.

                    -As you might be able to tell, Spider-Man means a lot to me, and for a very long time. At a brief glance,
                    you may not see anything special. A dorky superhero saving the day and always doing the right thing.
                    Another colorful character in a funny suit. But I assure you, there is much more than meets the eye
                    with Spider-Man. His unqie set of powers, iconic moments, rich lore, and more truly set spiderman above
                    the rest.
