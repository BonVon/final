                <h2 id="strength">Super Strength</h2>
                <p>
                    Spider-Mans super strength is no joke! After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker was given the proportional strength of a spider. This allows him to perform
                    superhuman acts of strength. He can lift several tons, allowing him to go head-to-head with some of Marvel's most powerful villians. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You should knbow, it is much more complicated than big muscles!
                    Spider-Mans body produces less of the chemicals responsible for fatigue and muscle pain, allowing him to swing, jump, and run through New York City beating up bad guys without taking a beat.
                    However, this strength extends far beyond his muscles. microscopic hairs covering his body allow Spider-Man to stick to almsot any surface. This allows him an extra element in his fighting style, taking
                    on foes from above or below!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But perhaps one of his most admirable applications of his strength is on his willpower. What I believe sets Spider-Man apart from the rest his his indomitable will. Though he is strong, Peter's true strength
                    resides in his ability to overcome obstacles otherwise insurmountable to the average man. By pushing his body beyonf its physical limits, Spider-Man has been able to stop speeding trains, land crashing planes,
                    and lift a buildings worth of rubble off his back. Of course his physical strength is impressive, but what truly makes him special is his ability to, "Always get back up".

                <h2 id="sense">Spidey Senses</h2>
                <p>
                    One of Spider-Mans most essential and extraordinary powers is his Spidey Senses. His radioactive spider bite has granted him heightened percetion that has become one of his most iconic powers.
                    Essentially, it acts as a warning system, a "sixth sense" if you will, far beyond the capabilities of any regular human.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As danger approaches, whether it be from a looming villian or impending disaster, Peter's Spidey Senses will kick in, resulting in a tingling sensation in the base of his skull. This has given rise to perhaps
                    one of Spidey's most iconic lines, "My Spider Senses are tingling". It is an instinctive, split-second reaction that allows Spider-Man to react with superhuman speed and agility. Often times, Peter's senses are 
                    explained to be him sensing the slightest of vibrations in the air. However, his spider senses constantly border on the spirtual. Peter's spidey senses allow him to navigate complex social situations granting him
                    foresight in situations where there could be no plausible explanation for his alertness. For example, his spidey senses work almost as a lie detector or way of unmasking the true intentions of possible foes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is a constant radar, keeping him always one step ahead in the fast paced an chaotic world of superheros and villians. In the heat of battle, those spidey senses become Spider-Man's greatest ally. Constantly guiding
                    him through the chaos and ensuring him that he can save the day and keep the city safe. It is a power that blends intuition, reflexes, and uncanny awareness, making Spider-Man an even more formidable and iconic hero.

                <h2 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h2>
                <p>
                    Spider-Man's intelligence is just as impressive as his acrobatic feats and web-slinging skills. Behind the mask of this web-slinging superhero is Peter Parker, a brilliant mind with a love for science and innovation. 
                    Gifted with a natural intellect, Peter excels in various scientific disciplines most commonly, chemistry and physics.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His prowess isn't limited to textbooks; Peter's quick thinking and problem-solving abilities make him a true genius. Whether he's developing his own web-fluid on the fly or devising ingenious strategies to outsmart 
                    formidable foes, Spider-Man's intelligence is a defining aspect of his superhero persona.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Peter's boundless curiosity and passion for learning drive him to constantly push the boundaries of his understanding. As a photographer for the Daily Bugle, he showcases not only his scientific know-how but also his 
                    creative eye.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is this combination of smarts, inventive thinking, and a knack for adapting to unpredictable situations that sets Spider-Man apart from other colorful heros. His intelligence isn't just a tool for crafting gadgets 
                    and battling villains; it's a key element of his identity, shaping the way he approaches challenges and contributes to the greater good. In the end, it's not just about his spider powersâ€”it's the brilliant mind behind 
                    the mask that truly makes Spider-Man a superhero to reckon with.

                <h2 id="agility">Agility</h2>
                <p>
                    Spider-Man's agility is responsible for his breathtaking dance across the skyline of New York City. Fueled by the proportional strength and reflexes granted to him by that radioactive spider bite, Peter Parker's movements are filled with the grace of a seasoned acrobat and the precision of a master martial artist.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His agility doesn't  just allow him to avoid punches or swing effortlessly between skyscrapers, it's a symphony of motion that defies the laws of physics. Spider-Man seems to defy gravity as he flips, twists, and somersaults through the air, making even the most complex maneuvers appear as effortless as a leisurely stroll.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the most crucial parts to the success of any video game or film adaptation of Spider-Man is the proper portrayal of his infamous swinging. It is so important to what makes Spider-Man who he is, an imperfect representation of it is a silver bullet to any project.
                    In the midst of battle, Spider-Man's agility gives him a strategic advantage, enabling him to outmaneuver foes with superior strength and speed. Whether he's gracefully dodging a barrage of attacks or landing a series of lightning-fast blows, Spider-Man's agility is the unseen force that takes him into a league of his own.
